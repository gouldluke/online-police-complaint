As a victim of police brutality
I would like the ability to report the offense
So that officers will be held accountable for their actions

Scenario: An officer has commit an illegal traffic stop
    Given   A citizen is pulled over by police
    And     The officer arrests the individual after they refused an illegal search of their vehicle
    When    The individual submits an online complaint
    Then    The department should initiate an investigation with the officer in question
    And     Take into account other online complaints and other information
    And     Communicate with victims of the officer and believe their testimony
    And     Take significant action to correct the officers behavior
